This is Laika, an open source electronic health record (EHR) testing framework.

The target platform is JRuby on Rails, running under Glassfish.

To run the spec suite:

 $ rake spec
 or
 $ jruby -S rake spec

To run the selenium test suite (the app server must be running in test mode at port 4000):

 $ rake selenium:test
 or
 $ jruby -S rake selenium:test

For complete validation functionality the UMLS database (including SNOMED)
is required, see: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/

The Laika SVN repository is hosted on SourceForge:
